exercises to plot solids in 3d using python

I have worked on several plotting exercises on simple solids, in order to further my understanding of:
- python
- python notebook
- matplotlib 3D
- pyplot 3D
- geometry

all exercises can be viewed directly here on GitHub, as the python notebook files will render correctly by default.

note: "animate.py" is a script that I have developed to rotate solids 360 degrees along the z-axis and generate an animated gif.
this is quite useful if one wants to embed the solid into a website or a notebook by showing how it looks on all sides, instead of the static picture that pyplot will render on a notebook.
